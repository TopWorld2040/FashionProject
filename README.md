##Introduction
In the modern world, the way you dress plays an important role in a personâ€™s image in society. It reflects your status and position, that is, it defines your role in society. In order to create clothing patterns you need to know the fundamentals of patterns(sizing tables, sizes of additions, etc). A template is usually first made out of paper, which is used to trace your pattern on fabric.
Creating a pattern is a labor-intensive process, because it needs to be adjusted several times. Consequently, time spent on a pattern increases as you add additional sizes. 
Fashion Project significantly speeds up the designing process and minimizes costs as your digital pattern can be altered and shown in 3D to test the quality.
